        <h1>Privacy Policy – Swift Go Browser</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 8, 2026</p>
        
        <p>Swift Go - Fast & Private Browser is a privacy-focused mobile web browser designed to provide a secure, transparent, and user-controlled browsing experience. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how user data is handled, stored, protected, and managed within the application. This policy applies to all users and complies with <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/" target="_blank">Google Play Developer Policies</a>, child safety requirements, and general data protection principles. By using Swift Go Browser, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser is built with user privacy as a core design principle. The application is developed using Flutter and is designed to function without collecting personal user information. The browser does not require account registration, login credentials, or identity verification. All browsing-related data remains strictly on the user's device. The purpose of this policy is to provide complete transparency about how data is managed so users can make informed decisions. The app does not engage in tracking, profiling, or selling user data. Users retain full ownership and control of their information at all times.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection Overview</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser only stores data that is essential for core browser functionality. This includes browsing history, search history, bookmarks, open tabs, cookies, cache files, downloads, and website storage. All such data is stored locally on the user's device and is never transmitted to Swift Go servers. The app does not collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, or device identifiers. No analytics, telemetry, or behavioral tracking systems are implemented in the app.</p>

        <h2>3. Browsing History & Search History</h2>
        <p>When users browse websites in normal mode, Swift Go Browser locally stores visited URLs, page titles, timestamps, and favicons to help users revisit content easily. Search queries entered in the address bar are also saved locally for convenience. This data improves usability but is never shared externally. Users can clear browsing and search history at any time from the app settings. In Incognito Mode, no browsing or search history is stored under any circumstances.</p>

        <h2>4. Storage, Cache & Website Data</h2>
        <p>The browser uses local storage and cache systems to enhance performance and reduce loading times. Cache files store temporary website resources, while web storage supports website functionality such as preferences and session data. All storage remains confined to the device. Users can clear cache and website data manually from the settings menu. Clearing this data may log users out of websites but improves privacy and frees device storage.</p>

        <h2>5. Cookies Policy</h2>
        <p>Cookies are used solely to enable proper website functionality such as login sessions, language preferences, and form data. Swift Go Browser does not inject, modify, or create tracking cookies. All cookies originate from websites visited by the user. Users can delete cookies at any time. In Incognito Mode, cookies are automatically removed when the session ends.</p>

        <h2>6. Download Management</h2>
        <p>Files downloaded through Swift Go Browser are saved directly to the user's device storage. The app does not analyze, upload, or scan downloaded files. Download notifications are shown silently in the system notification panel without intrusive pop-ups. Users can delete downloaded files manually or disable download notifications via system settings.</p>

        <h2>7. Incognito Mode</h2>
        <p>Incognito Mode allows users to browse privately by preventing storage of browsing history, search history, cookies, and site data. Each incognito session is isolated from normal browsing sessions. However, Incognito Mode does not hide activity from websites, internet service providers, or network administrators. Downloaded files remain on the device after exiting Incognito Mode.</p>

        <h2>8. Permissions & Access</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser requests permissions only when necessary for specific actions. Storage permission is requested for file downloads. Camera, microphone, and location permissions are requested only when a website explicitly asks for access. Internet permission is required for browsing. Notification permission is used to display download progress and system alerts. Users may revoke any permission at any time via Android system settings.</p>

        <h2>9. Notifications Policy</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser uses a privacy-friendly notification system. Notifications are displayed silently in the system notification panel and do not appear as intrusive pop-ups on the screen. Notifications are used only for functional purposes such as download progress or system messages. Users can enable or disable notifications at any time from the device or app settings.</p>

        <h2>10. Firebase Services</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser may use Firebase services strictly for essential app stability and performance purposes, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crash reporting (to identify and fix application crashes)</li>
            <li>Performance monitoring (to improve app reliability)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Firebase does <strong>not</strong> collect browsing history, visited websites, search queries, or personal user content.</p>

        <p>Any data processed by Firebase is limited to technical diagnostics and is handled in accordance with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Google Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Firebase usage is fully compliant with <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/" target="_blank">Google Play Developer Policies</a>.</strong></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>11. Advertising (Ads) Services</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser may display advertisements through compliant third-party ad networks such as <a href="https://admob.google.com/" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a>.</p>

        <p>Advertising services may use cookies, advertising identifiers, or similar technologies to serve relevant ads, as governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

        <p>Swift Go Browser does not directly access, store, or control advertising identifiers. Users can manage ad personalization through their <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Ad Settings</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Advertising implementation follows <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753" target="_blank">Google Play Ads and User Data policies</a>.</strong></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>12. Child Safety & Age Policy</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser is intended for users aged 13 years and above. The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If a parent or guardian believes that a child has used the app, they may contact the developer for data removal. The app complies with <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335" target="_blank">child safety and family policy requirements</a> and does not include content targeted at children.</p>

        <h2>13. User Data Control & Deletion</h2>
        <p>Users have full control over all stored data. Browsing history, bookmarks, cookies, cache, downloads, and website data can be deleted instantly from the app settings. Once deleted, data cannot be recovered. No backups of user data are maintained by the developer.</p>

        <h2>14. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>All data is stored within the app's private storage directory, protected by Android sandboxing. Other apps cannot access this data. While data is stored in plain text, users are encouraged to use device-level encryption and screen locks for additional security. Secure HTTPS connections are supported whenever available.</p>

        <h2>15. Acceptance of Third-Party Website Policies</h2>
        <p>By using Swift Go Browser, users acknowledge that websites visited may have their own privacy policies, terms, advertisements, cookies, and data collection practices. Swift Go Browser does not control or take responsibility for third-party website policies.</p>

        <h2>16. Contact Information</h2>
        <div class="contact-info">
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer at:</p>
            <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:swiftgobrowser@gmail.com">swiftgobrowser@gmail.com</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2>17. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be reflected with a revised "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
