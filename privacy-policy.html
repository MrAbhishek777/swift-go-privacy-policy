        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Display Name:</strong> Swift Go</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Swift Go – Fast &amp; Private Browser</strong>, a fast, secure, and feature-rich mobile browser application designed to provide you with an excellent web browsing experience. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our browser application. We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy. By using Swift Go Browser, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our application. This policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of the app after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes. The most current version of this policy is always available from within the app under Settings &gt; Privacy Policy.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>2. Browser Functionality &amp; Web Navigation</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser is a full-featured web browser that allows you to access and navigate websites across the internet. The browser uses WebView technology (specifically <strong>flutter_inappwebview</strong>) to render web pages with full JavaScript support, media playback capabilities, and modern web standards compliance. When you browse websites, the app loads and displays web content just like any standard browser.</p>
        <p>The browser supports <strong>multiple tabs</strong>, allowing you to have several web pages open simultaneously. It includes a smart address bar that accepts both URLs and search queries, automatically detecting whether you have entered a website address or a search term using our Chrome-like smart URL detection system. The browser maintains a navigation history for each tab, enabling you to go back and forward through previously visited pages.</p>
        <p>We support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols with visual security indicators. The browser can handle forms, cookies, local storage, and multimedia content. We also support <strong>deep linking</strong>, allowing you to open web links from other applications directly in Swift Go Browser. The browser is optimized for performance with hardware acceleration enabled for smooth scrolling and fast page rendering. Additionally, the browser includes a <strong>Desktop Mode</strong> toggle that changes the user-agent string to request the full desktop version of any website, giving you access to features typically available only on computers.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>3. Permissions System &amp; Runtime Requests</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser implements a privacy-focused permission system that requests access to device features only when they are actually needed by a website or app feature. We <strong>NEVER</strong> request permissions at app startup or installation. All permissions are requested at runtime when a specific feature requires them.</p>

        <p><strong>Internet Permission (INTERNET):</strong> Automatically granted. Allows the app to access the internet for browsing websites, fetching news, and downloading files. This is essential for all browser functionality.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage Permissions (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> Requested only when you initiate a download or when the media player needs to access a downloaded file. On Android 11 and above, we use scoped storage which provides better privacy protection. We never access your files without your explicit action.</p>
        <p><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> Requested only when a website asks to use your camera (e.g., for video calls or taking photos on web apps). You will see a permission dialog before any access is granted.</p>
        <p><strong>Microphone Permission:</strong> Requested in two cases — (1) when a website needs audio input such as voice calls or voice-based web apps, and (2) when you activate the <strong>Voice Search</strong> feature from the search bar to dictate search queries. The permission dialog clearly states which feature needs microphone access.</p>
        <p><strong>Location Permission (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION):</strong> Requested only when a website asks for your geographic location (e.g., maps or weather services). You have full control to allow or deny location access, and you can revoke it anytime from Android settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Notification Permission (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> On Android 13+, this permission is NEVER automatically requested by our app. Notifications are only shown if you manually enable them from Android system settings. We respect your choice to keep notifications disabled.</p>
        <p><strong>Phone Permission:</strong> Requested only when a website needs to make phone calls via a <code>tel:</code> URI link. This is rare and only happens with specific web applications.</p>
        <p>All permission requests include a clear explanation of why the permission is needed. You can deny any permission and the app will continue to work, though the specific feature requiring that permission may not function. You can review and change all permissions anytime from <em>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Swift Go Browser &gt; Permissions</em>.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>4. Security System &amp; HTTPS Detection</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a comprehensive security system designed to protect you while browsing. The browser actively monitors the security status of every website you visit and provides clear visual indicators about connection security. When you visit a website, our security system checks whether the connection uses HTTPS (secure) or HTTP (unsecure) protocol.</p>
        <p>For HTTPS websites, you will see a <strong>lock icon</strong> in the address bar confirming that your connection is encrypted. For HTTP websites, you will see a <strong>warning indicator</strong> showing the connection is not secure. Our security system also validates SSL/TLS certificates. While we do allow users to proceed to websites with certificate issues to maintain browsing flexibility, we clearly warn you about potential security risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Cleartext Traffic Support:</strong> Swift Go Browser allows HTTP (non-encrypted) connections for compatibility with websites that do not support HTTPS. This means some websites may load using unencrypted connections. When accessing HTTP websites, the browser clearly displays a security warning indicator. We strongly recommend users avoid entering sensitive information on HTTP websites.</p>
        <p>Additionally, our security system includes protection against malicious downloads and suspicious file types. When you attempt to download files, the system checks file extensions and warns you about potentially dangerous file types (such as APK executables). The browser maintains a <strong>secure sandbox environment</strong>, isolating web content from your device's core system to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive device features without permission. We also implement a <strong>Find in Page</strong> feature that searches text on-screen within the current web page entirely offline without sending any data externally.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>5. Advertisement System (AdMob Integration)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements, which helps us keep the app free for all users. Our ad system is configured to show ads only at specific, non-intrusive moments during your app usage. Here is exactly when and how ads are displayed:</p>
        <p><strong>App Open Ads:</strong> When you launch Swift Go Browser from a closed state (not when switching back from another app), you may periodically see a full-screen ad. The ad loads in the background and displays without disrupting your browsing experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Download Complete Ads:</strong> When a file download completes successfully, an interstitial ad may be shown. This happens only after the download is 100% complete and is shown once per completed download.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear All Tabs Ads:</strong> When you use the "Clear All Tabs" feature to close all your open browser tabs at once, an interstitial ad may be displayed. This happens only when you explicitly clear all tabs, not when closing individual tabs.</p>
        <p><strong>No Ads During Browsing:</strong> We specifically do NOT show ads while you are actively browsing websites, reading news, using the media player, using voice search, or navigating between pages. Your browsing experience remains completely uninterrupted.</p>
        <p><strong>AdMob Data Collection:</strong> Google AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized ads, including your advertising ID, device information, IP address, and app usage patterns. This data is collected and processed by Google according to their privacy policy. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device's ad settings (<em>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</em>). Even if you opt out, you will still see non-personalized ads.</p>
        <p><strong>Ad Unit IDs:</strong> We use three specific ad units: App Open Ad (<code>ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/3079064528</code>), Download Complete Ad (<code>ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/4616331883</code>), and Clear Tabs Ad (<code>ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/9452901184</code>). These comply with Google's advertising policies.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>6. Download System &amp; File Management</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a powerful download manager built using the <strong>flutter_downloader</strong> library. When you click a download link on a website, the browser automatically detects common file types (including MP4, MP3, PDF, ZIP, JPG, PNG, APK, DOC, XLS, PPT, and many others) and initiates the download process. Before starting any download, the app requests storage permission if not already granted. On Android 11+, we use scoped storage which means we only access the Downloads folder, not your entire device storage.</p>
        <p>The download manager provides real-time progress tracking showing download speed, percentage completed, and estimated time remaining. All downloads run in the background, allowing you to continue browsing while files download. You can pause, resume, or cancel downloads at any time from the Downloads screen. The system supports multiple simultaneous downloads.</p>
        <p>Each download is assigned a notification that shows progress. When a download completes, you receive a completion notification with a checkmark (✓) icon and options to open the file or view it in your file manager. Failed downloads show error notifications with options to retry. Downloaded files are stored in your device's standard Downloads folder (<code>/storage/emulated/0/Download/</code>) and are securely shared with other apps using Android's FileProvider system when you choose to open them.</p>
        <p><strong>Permissions Used:</strong> READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (Android ≤10), DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION, and INTERNET.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>7. Media Player (Video &amp; Audio Playback)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a built-in <strong>Media Player</strong> for playing downloaded video and audio files directly within the app, so you do not need a separate media application. The video player supports popular formats including MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, FLV, WMV, WebM, 3GP, and M4V. The audio player supports MP3, AAC, WAV, OGG, and other common audio formats.</p>
        <p><strong>Video Player Features:</strong> The built-in video player provides play/pause controls, a seekbar for precise navigation, a 10-second forward/backward double-tap gesture, a fullscreen/portrait orientation toggle, a screen lock feature to prevent accidental touches during playback, and an option to open the file with an external player if the format is not natively supported.</p>
        <p><strong>Audio Player Features:</strong> The audio player provides full playback controls (play, pause, seek, next/previous) for audio files downloaded from websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> The media player reads files only from your device's local storage (specifically from the Downloads folder). It does NOT connect to the internet, does NOT collect viewing history, does NOT send any data to remote servers, and does NOT require any additional permissions beyond the storage access already granted for the download system. All media playback is entirely local and private.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>8. Voice Search System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a <strong>Voice Search</strong> feature that allows you to search the web by speaking instead of typing. This feature uses the device's built-in <strong>speech_to_text</strong> engine (Android's on-device speech recognition) to convert your spoken words into a text search query.</p>
        <p><strong>How Voice Search Works:</strong> When you tap the microphone icon in the search bar, the app requests microphone permission (if not already granted). Once permission is granted, the app begins listening for your voice input. Your speech is processed by Android's native speech recognition engine. After 5 seconds of silence or 12 seconds maximum, the listening session automatically stops. The recognized text is then placed in the search bar for you to confirm or edit before searching.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy of Voice Data:</strong> Voice Search is powered by Android's on-device speech recognition API (<code>speech_to_text</code>). Audio may be processed by Google's cloud servers depending on your device's speech recognition settings, but this is governed by Google's privacy policy and not by Swift Go Browser. We do NOT record, store, or transmit your voice audio on our servers.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>9. News Feed System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a built-in <strong>News Feed</strong> that displays trending news articles directly on your home screen. The news feed is powered by <strong>Google News RSS</strong> (India edition: <code>news.google.com/rss?hl=en-IN&amp;gl=IN&amp;ceid=IN:en</code>), which is a publicly available, region-specific news feed.</p>
        <p><strong>How the News Feed Works:</strong> When you open the home screen, the app fetches the latest news headlines from Google News RSS. The feed is parsed locally on your device. Article titles, links, source names, and thumbnail images are extracted and displayed. Tapping a news article opens the full article in the browser using the standard WebView, just like loading any other website.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy of News Feed:</strong> The news feed request is a standard HTTP GET request to Google News servers. Google's servers will receive your device's IP address as part of any standard network request. We do NOT store, log, or analyze which news articles you read. We do NOT build a reading profile. Your news feed interaction history is NOT stored anywhere in the app.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>10. Notification System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a comprehensive notification system to keep you informed about important events such as download progress, completed downloads, website alerts, and periodic news updates. Our notification system is designed with privacy in mind and operates on an opt-in basis. All notification processing happens entirely on your device, and no notification data is transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <p><strong>Notification Permission:</strong> On Android 13 and above, notification permission (POST_NOTIFICATIONS) must be explicitly granted by the user. We NEVER automatically request this permission when you install or open the app. You are always in full control. Notifications only appear if you manually enable them from Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Notifications. You can disable all or specific notification categories from Android system settings at any time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How Our Notification System Works:</strong> The notification system uses open-source Flutter packages that are approved by Google Play and work entirely on your device. The system displays notifications for downloads, website alerts, and news updates using Android's standard notification features. All notifications are processed locally on your device with no external server communication required for the notification display itself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Categories:</strong> We use Android's Notification Channel system, which allows you to control each type of notification independently from Android Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Notifications. Our app has five distinct notification categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Download Progress:</strong> Shows real-time download progress with speed, percentage, and file name during active downloading.</li>
            <li><strong>Download Complete:</strong> Displays a notification when a download finishes, tapping opens the Downloads screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Download Failed:</strong> Shows an alert if a download fails, tapping opens the Downloads screen to retry.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Notifications:</strong> Displays notifications from websites you visit (such as WhatsApp Web or news sites), tapping reopens that specific website.</li>
            <li><strong>News Notifications:</strong> Shows periodic Google News headline notifications, tapping opens the full article in the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Download Notifications:</strong> When you download a file, a persistent notification shows the file name, download speed, and completion percentage in real-time. This notification is managed entirely on your device using Android's native notification system. When the download completes, the notification icon changes to a checkmark. No personal data is included in download notifications - only the file name you are downloading is shown.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Website Notifications:</strong> Some websites (such as WhatsApp Web or news portals) request permission to send you browser notifications. When a website requests permission to send you notifications, our browser asks for your permission through a native Android dialog. If you grant permission, we display website notifications as native Android notifications. Each website notification includes the URL of the originating website. Tapping the notification reopens Swift Go Browser and navigates directly to that website. We do NOT store, log, or transmit the content of website notifications to our servers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Google News Notifications:</strong> Our app can periodically fetch Google News headlines and display them as notifications. This feature uses Android's background task scheduler, which is the same technology used by Gmail, Chrome, and other major apps for periodic background work. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app registers a background task that runs approximately every 15 minutes when your device is connected to the internet.</li>
            <li>This background task makes an HTTPS request to the publicly available Google News RSS feed (https://news.google.com/rss), which is the same URL that any browser would request when you visit Google News.</li>
            <li>The response contains news headlines, article links, and publication dates, which are processed locally on your device.</li>
            <li>We compare the fetched article links against a locally stored list of "already seen" articles to avoid showing duplicate notifications.</li>
            <li>We display notifications only for articles that are genuinely new, showing up to 3 notifications per 15-minute cycle to avoid notification spam.</li>
            <li>The article link is marked as seen in local storage so the same article never generates a duplicate notification.</li>
            <li>Tapping a news notification opens Swift Go Browser and navigates directly to the full article URL.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>News Notification Privacy:</strong> When fetching Google News, only your device's IP address is sent to Google News servers, which is unavoidable for any internet request and is the same as opening Google Chrome and visiting Google News. No account data, user ID, or personal information is sent to our servers or to Google News. The list of "seen article links" is stored exclusively in your device's local storage and never leaves your device. This local list is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app. You can disable news notifications independently by turning off the News Notifications channel in Android Settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Navigation:</strong> When you tap a notification, the app opens and navigates to the relevant screen. The behavior depends on whether the app is open, in the background, or fully closed. For download notifications, tapping opens the Downloads screen. For website and news notifications, tapping opens the specific website URL in the browser. All navigation data is processed only within your device. No navigation events are logged or transmitted to our servers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Privacy Summary for Notifications:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No notification content is transmitted to our servers.</li>
            <li>Notifications only show file names (downloads), website-provided text (website notifications), or public headlines (news).</li>
            <li>The "seen articles" list used to prevent duplicate news notifications is stored locally on your device only.</li>
            <li>News fetching makes HTTPS requests only to the public Google News RSS endpoint, which is the same request any browser would make.</li>
            <li>You can disable all notification types independently from Android Settings without affecting any other browser functionality.</li>
            <li>On Android 13+, notification permission is never automatically requested - it is purely opt-in.</li>
            <li>The background task for news notifications requires certain permissions (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, FOREGROUND_SERVICE) to function reliably, which allows the task to restart after device reboots and run in the background.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>11. Search Engine &amp; Smart URL System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser allows you to choose your preferred <strong>search engine</strong> for all web searches performed from the address bar or voice search. The following search engines are supported: <strong>Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex</strong>. You can change your preferred search engine at any time from <em>Settings &gt; Search Engine</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> When you type a query in the address bar, our smart URL detection system determines whether you have typed a URL (domain, IP, or link with a scheme like <code>http://</code>) or a search query. If it is a URL, the browser navigates directly to it. If it is a search query, it is forwarded to your chosen search engine using that engine's standard search URL with proper URL encoding. We support extended URL schemes including <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>ftp</code>, <code>mailto</code>, <code>tel</code>, <code>market</code>, <code>intent</code>, <code>whatsapp</code>, and <code>tg</code> (Telegram).</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your search queries are sent directly to your chosen search engine's servers, and their respective privacy policies govern data handling. Swift Go Browser does NOT intercept, log, or analyze your search queries. Your search engine preference is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>12. Home Screen Shortcuts System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a <strong>Home Screen Shortcuts</strong> feature that allows you to save frequently visited websites as quick-access shortcut tiles directly on the app's home screen. This provides faster navigation to your favorite sites without needing to type URLs repeatedly.</p>
        <p><strong>How Shortcuts Work:</strong> While browsing a website, you can tap the three-dot menu and select "Add Shortcut." The current page's title and URL are saved as a shortcut. Shortcuts appear on the home screen as icon tiles with the website's favicon and title. You can rearrange shortcuts by long-pressing and dragging. Shortcuts can be deleted individually by long-pressing and selecting delete.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Shortcut data (website title and URL) is stored locally on your device using <strong>SharedPreferences</strong>. This data is only present on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. The website favicon displayed in shortcuts is loaded from Google's public favicon service (<code>google.com/s2/favicons</code>) when displaying a shortcut, which involves a network request to Google's servers with the domain name of the website. No personal data beyond the domain name is sent in this request.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>13. Data Storage (Bookmarks, History, Cache &amp; Cookies)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser stores various types of data locally on your device to enhance your browsing experience. All data is stored locally and is <strong>NEVER</strong> transmitted to our servers or any third-party services (except as required by websites you visit).</p>
        <p><strong>Browsing History:</strong> The app maintains a record of websites you visit, including the page title, URL, and timestamp. This history is stored locally using the <strong>Hive</strong> database and Provider state management. You can view, search, and delete individual entries or clear all history at once from the History screen.</p>
        <p><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> When you bookmark a webpage using the three-dot menu, we store the page title, URL, favicon URL, and the date you bookmarked it. Bookmarks are stored locally and persist across app sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Websites you visit may store cookies in the browser to remember your login sessions, preferences, and other site-specific data. These cookies are managed by the WebView component and stored in the app's private data directory. You can clear all cookies from the "Clear Browser Data" screen.</p>
        <p><strong>Cache:</strong> The browser caches website resources (images, scripts, stylesheets) to speed up page loading on repeat visits. You can clear the cache anytime from "Clear Browser Data."</p>
        <p><strong>App Preferences:</strong> We store your app settings using <strong>SharedPreferences</strong>, including your selected search engine, dark/light mode preference, onboarding completion status, home screen shortcuts, notification preferences, and other app configuration settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Download Records:</strong> Information about your downloads (file name, URL, download date, file size, file path) is stored locally using the <strong>flutter_downloader</strong> library's built-in database to maintain your download history.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear Browser Data:</strong> You have complete control over your stored data via the "Clear Browser Data" feature in Settings, which lets you selectively delete history, cookies, cache, local storage, and other browsing data.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Location:</strong> All data is stored in the app's private directory (<code>/data/data/com.abhi.swiftgo/</code>) protected by Android's app sandbox. When you uninstall Swift Go Browser, all stored data is automatically deleted.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>14. Incognito Mode (Private Browsing)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes an <strong>Incognito Mode</strong> that provides enhanced privacy for your browsing sessions. You can open an Incognito tab from the three-dot menu item "New Incognito Tab." Incognito tabs are visually distinguished from normal tabs.</p>
        <p><strong>What Incognito Mode Does:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No History Saved:</strong> Websites visited in Incognito Mode are NOT added to your browsing history.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies Persisted:</strong> Cookies created during an incognito session are temporary and deleted when you close the incognito tab.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cache Retention:</strong> Cached resources from incognito browsing are not permanently stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Session:</strong> Incognito tabs run in a separate browsing context from normal tabs, allowing different login states simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>No Autofill:</strong> Form data and search queries entered in Incognito Mode are not saved for autofill suggestions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What Incognito Mode Does NOT Do:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Anonymous:</strong> Incognito Mode does NOT make you anonymous online. Websites can still see your IP address, and your ISP can still see your browsing activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Downloads Are Saved:</strong> Files downloaded in Incognito Mode are still saved to your device's Downloads folder.</li>
            <li><strong>Bookmarks Are Permanent:</strong> Any bookmark you add in Incognito Mode is saved permanently.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>15. Dark Mode &amp; Theme System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> (also called Night Mode) and a <strong>Light Mode</strong> theme system that adjusts the app's color scheme for comfortable viewing in different lighting conditions. You can switch between these themes from the Settings screen.</p>
        <p><strong>App-Level Dark Mode:</strong> When you enable Dark Mode, the app's UI elements switch to a dark color scheme with reduced glare.</p>
        <p><strong>WebView Dark Mode:</strong> The browser also applies a CSS-based dark filter to web pages when Dark Mode is enabled, reducing the brightness and adjusting colors of websites that do not natively support dark mode. This is done entirely on-device using CSS injection (no network requests).</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your theme preference (dark or light) is stored locally in SharedPreferences on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
        <h2>16. Third-Party Services &amp; Data Sharing</h2>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> We do NOT sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The only data sharing that occurs is with AdMob/Firebase (automated for app functionality), with websites you choose to visit (as part of normal browsing), and as required by law or legal process.</p>
