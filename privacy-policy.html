            <p><strong>Display Name:</strong> Swift Go</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Swift Go - Fast & Private Browser, a fast and secure mobile browser application designed to provide you with an excellent web browsing experience. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our browser application. We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy. By using Swift Go Browser, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our application. This policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of the app after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h2>2. Browser Functionality & Web Navigation</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser is a full-featured web browser that allows you to access and navigate websites across the internet. The browser uses WebView technology (specifically flutter_inappwebview) to render web pages with full JavaScript support, media playback capabilities, and modern web standards compliance. When you browse websites, the app loads and displays web content just like any standard browser. The browser supports multiple tabs, allowing you to have several web pages open simultaneously. It includes a smart address bar that accepts both URLs and search queries, automatically detecting whether you've entered a website address or a search term. The browser maintains a navigation history for each tab, enabling you to go back and forward through previously visited pages. We support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, with visual indicators to show you when you're on a secure connection. The browser can handle various web technologies including forms, cookies, local storage, and multimedia content. We also support deep linking, allowing you to open web links from other applications directly in Swift Go Browser. The browser is optimized for performance with hardware acceleration enabled for smooth scrolling and fast page rendering.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions System & Runtime Requests</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser implements a privacy-focused permission system that requests access to device features only when they are actually needed by a website or app feature. We NEVER request permissions at app startup or installation. All permissions are requested at runtime when a specific feature requires them. Here's how each permission works:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Internet Permission (INTERNET):</strong> This permission is automatically granted and allows the app to access the internet for browsing websites. This is essential for browser functionality and does not require user approval.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Storage Permissions (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> These permissions are requested only when you initiate a download or when a website needs to access files. On Android 11 and above, we use scoped storage which provides better privacy protection. We never access your files without your explicit action.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> Requested only when a website asks to use your camera (e.g., for video calls, taking photos on web apps). You'll see a permission dialog explaining why the camera is needed before any access is granted.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Microphone Permission:</strong> Requested only when a website needs audio input (e.g., voice calls, voice search on websites). The permission dialog clearly states which feature needs microphone access.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Location Permission (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION):</strong> Requested only when a website asks for your location (e.g., maps, weather services). You have full control to allow or deny location access, and you can revoke it anytime from Android settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Permission (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> On Android 13+, this permission is NEVER automatically requested by our app. Notifications are only shown if you manually enable them from Android system settings. We respect your choice to keep notifications disabled.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Phone Permission:</strong> Requested only when a website needs to make phone calls or access phone state. This is rare and only happens with specific web applications.</p>
        
        <p>All permission requests include a clear explanation of why the permission is needed and which feature requires it. You can deny any permission, and the app will continue to work, though the specific feature requiring that permission may not function. You can review and change all permissions anytime from your device's Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Permissions.</p>

        <h2>4. Security System & HTTPS Detection</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a comprehensive security system designed to protect you while browsing. The browser actively monitors the security status of every website you visit and provides clear visual indicators about connection security. When you visit a website, our security system checks whether the connection uses HTTPS (secure) or HTTP (unsecure) protocol. For HTTPS websites, you'll see a lock icon or secure indicator in the address bar, confirming that your connection is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping. For HTTP websites, you'll see a warning indicator showing that the connection is not secure, and any data you enter could potentially be intercepted.</p>
        
        <p>Our security system also handles SSL/TLS certificates, validating that websites are who they claim to be. While we do allow users to proceed to websites with certificate issues (to maintain browsing flexibility), we clearly warn you about potential security risks. The browser supports modern encryption standards and automatically upgrades connections to HTTPS when available. We also implement protection against mixed content, warning you when a secure page tries to load insecure resources.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, our security system includes protection against malicious downloads and suspicious file types. When you attempt to download files, the system checks file extensions and warns you about potentially dangerous file types like APK files or executables. The browser maintains a secure sandbox environment, isolating web content from your device's core system to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive device features without permission. We regularly update our security protocols to protect against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>5. Advertisement System (AdMob Integration)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, which helps us keep the app free for all users. We have implemented a carefully designed ad system that balances revenue generation with user experience. Our ad system is configured to show ads only at specific, non-intrusive moments during your app usage. Here's exactly when and how ads are displayed:</p>
        
        <p><strong>App Open Ads:</strong> When you launch the Swift Go Browser app (not every time, but periodically), you may see a full-screen ad. This ad appears only when you first open the app from a closed state, never when switching back from another app. The ad loads in the background and displays quickly without disrupting your browsing experience.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Download Complete Ads:</strong> When a file download completes successfully, an interstitial ad may be shown. This happens only after the download is 100% complete, ensuring the ad doesn't interfere with the download process. The ad is shown once per completed download.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Clear All Tabs Ads:</strong> When you use the "Clear All Tabs" feature to close all your open browser tabs at once, an interstitial ad may be displayed. This happens only when you explicitly clear all tabs, not when closing individual tabs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>No Ads During Browsing:</strong> We specifically do NOT show ads while you're actively browsing websites, reading content, or navigating between pages. Your browsing experience remains uninterrupted.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AdMob Data Collection:</strong> Google AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized ads, including your advertising ID, device information, IP address, and app usage patterns. This data is collected and processed by Google according to their privacy policy. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device's ad settings (Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization). Even if you opt out, you'll still see ads, but they won't be personalized based on your interests.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ad Unit IDs:</strong> We use three specific ad units: App Open Ad (ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/3079064528), Download Complete Ad (ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/4616331883), and Clear Tabs Ad (ca-app-pub-8523933423167815/9452901184). These are managed through our AdMob account and comply with Google's advertising policies.</p>

        <h2>6. Download System & File Management</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes a powerful download manager that allows you to download files from websites directly to your device. The download system is built using flutter_downloader library and provides comprehensive download management capabilities. Here's how the download system works and what permissions it requires:</p>
        
        <p>When you click a download link or a file on a website, the browser automatically detects common file types (including MP4, MP3, PDF, ZIP, JPG, PNG, APK, DOC, XLS, PPT, and many others) and initiates the download process. Before starting any download, the app requests storage permission if not already granted. On Android 11 and above, we use scoped storage which means we only access the Downloads folder, not your entire device storage.</p>
        
        <p>The download manager provides real-time progress tracking, showing you the download speed, percentage completed, and estimated time remaining. All downloads run in the background, allowing you to continue browsing while files download. You can pause, resume, or cancel downloads at any time from the downloads screen. The system supports multiple simultaneous downloads, managing them efficiently to optimize your device's resources.</p>
        
        <p>Each download is assigned a unique notification that shows progress in your notification panel. When a download completes, you receive a completion notification with options to open the file or view it in your file manager. Failed downloads are clearly marked with error messages, and you can retry them with a single tap. The download history is maintained within the app, showing all completed, failed, and cancelled downloads.</p>
        
        <p>Downloaded files are stored in your device's standard Downloads folder (typically /storage/emulated/0/Download/) with proper file naming to prevent conflicts. We use Android's FileProvider system to securely share downloaded files with other apps when you choose to open them. The download system respects your device's storage limits and will notify you if there's insufficient space before starting a download.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Permissions Used:</strong> READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (to check existing files), WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (to save downloaded files on Android 10 and below), DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION (to manage downloads), and INTERNET (to download files from the web).</p>

        <h2>7. Notification System</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser implements a comprehensive notification system to keep you informed about important events and download progress. Our notification system is designed with privacy in mind and operates on an opt-in basis. Here's how notifications work in our app:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Permission:</strong> On Android 13 and above, notification permission (POST_NOTIFICATIONS) must be granted by the user. We NEVER automatically request this permission when you install or open the app. Notifications will only appear if you manually enable them from your device's Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Notifications. If you don't enable notifications, the app works perfectly fine; you just won't receive notification alerts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Download Progress Notifications:</strong> When you download files, we show persistent notifications displaying the download progress, file name, download speed, and percentage completed. These notifications update in real-time as the download progresses. When a download completes, the notification changes to show completion status with action buttons to open the file or view it in your file manager. Failed downloads show error notifications with options to retry.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Network Status Notifications:</strong> The app monitors your internet connectivity and may show brief toast notifications (small pop-up messages) when your connection is lost or restored. These are not system notifications and don't require notification permission.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Website Notifications:</strong> Some websites may request permission to send you notifications. These are web push notifications and are separate from our app notifications. You can allow or deny these on a per-website basis, and they're managed through the browser's permission system.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Channels:</strong> We use Android notification channels to categorize notifications (Downloads, Network Status, etc.), allowing you to customize notification settings for each category. You can control notification sound, vibration, and visibility for each channel from Android settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Notification Interaction:</strong> When you tap on a download notification, the app opens and navigates directly to the downloads screen or the specific downloaded file. This deep linking functionality is handled through Android's notification intent system and stored temporarily in SharedPreferences to ensure proper navigation even when the app is closed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Our notifications never contain sensitive personal information. Download notifications only show file names and progress. We don't track or store your interaction with notifications beyond basic app navigation.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Storage (Bookmarks, History, Cache & Cookies)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser stores various types of data locally on your device to enhance your browsing experience and provide essential browser functionality. All data is stored locally on your device and is NEVER transmitted to our servers or any third-party services (except as required by websites you visit). Here's a detailed explanation of what data we store and how it's managed:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Browsing History:</strong> The app maintains a record of websites you visit, including the page title, URL, and timestamp. This history is stored locally using the Hive database and Provider state management. History allows you to quickly revisit previously viewed pages and provides search suggestions. You can view your complete history from the History screen, search through it, and delete individual entries or clear all history at once. History data never leaves your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> When you bookmark a webpage, we store the page title, URL, favicon (website icon), and the date you bookmarked it. Bookmarks are stored locally using Provider state management and persist across app sessions. You can organize, edit, and delete bookmarks anytime from the Bookmarks screen. Bookmark data is private and stored only on your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Websites you visit may store cookies in the browser to remember your login sessions, preferences, and other site-specific data. These cookies are managed by the WebView component and are stored in the app's private data directory. Cookies are essential for many websites to function properly (e.g., keeping you logged in). You can clear all cookies from the "Clear Browser Data" screen in app settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cache:</strong> The browser caches website resources (images, scripts, stylesheets) to speed up page loading on repeat visits. Cached data is stored in the app's cache directory and is managed automatically by the WebView engine. Cache helps reduce data usage and improve browsing speed. You can clear the cache anytime from the "Clear Browser Data" screen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Local Storage & Session Storage:</strong> Websites can store data locally using HTML5 Local Storage and Session Storage APIs. This data is managed by the WebView and is isolated per website. It's used by websites for various purposes like saving preferences, offline functionality, and app state. You can clear this data from the "Clear Browser Data" screen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>App Preferences:</strong> We store your app settings and preferences using SharedPreferences, including your selected search engine, dark mode preference, whether you've seen the onboarding screens, and other app configuration settings. This data is minimal and only used to customize your app experience.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Download Records:</strong> Information about your downloads (file name, URL, download date, file size, file path) is stored locally to maintain your download history. This allows you to track completed downloads and access downloaded files easily.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Clear Browser Data:</strong> You have complete control over your stored data. The app includes a "Clear Browser Data" feature that allows you to selectively delete browsing history, cookies, cache, and other stored data. You can choose what to delete and clear it with a single tap.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Location:</strong> All data is stored in the app's private directory on your device (/data/data/com.abhi.swiftgo/ and /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.abhi.swiftgo/). This data is protected by Android's app sandbox and is not accessible to other apps. When you uninstall Swift Go Browser, all stored data is automatically deleted by Android.</p>

        <h2>9. Incognito Mode (Private Browsing)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser includes an Incognito Mode feature that provides enhanced privacy for your browsing sessions. When you browse in Incognito Mode, the app modifies its data storage behavior to ensure your browsing activity remains private. Here's exactly how Incognito Mode works and what it does:</p>
        
        <p><strong>What Incognito Mode Does:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No History Saved:</strong> Websites you visit in Incognito Mode are NOT added to your browsing history. Once you close the incognito tab, there's no local record of the websites you visited.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies Persisted:</strong> Cookies created during an incognito session are temporary and are deleted when you close the incognito tab. Websites won't remember you after the session ends.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cache Retention:</strong> Cached resources from incognito browsing are not permanently stored. The cache is cleared when you close the incognito session.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Session:</strong> Incognito tabs run in a separate browsing context from your normal tabs. This means you can be logged into a website in a normal tab and browse the same website logged out (or with a different account) in an incognito tab.</li>
            <li><strong>No Autofill:</strong> Form data and search queries entered in Incognito Mode are not saved for autofill suggestions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What Incognito Mode Does NOT Do:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Anonymous:</strong> Incognito Mode does NOT make you anonymous on the internet. Websites you visit can still see your IP address, and your internet service provider (ISP) can still see your browsing activity.</li>
            <li><strong>No Download Privacy:</strong> Files you download in Incognito Mode are still saved to your device's Downloads folder and appear in your download history.</li>
            <li><strong>No Bookmark Privacy:</strong> If you bookmark a page in Incognito Mode, that bookmark is saved permanently like any other bookmark.</li>
            <li><strong>No Network Privacy:</strong> Your network administrator, ISP, or the websites you visit can still track your activity. Incognito Mode only affects local data storage on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>How to Use Incognito Mode:</strong> You can open an incognito tab from the tab switcher or menu. Incognito tabs are visually distinguished from normal tabs (typically with a different color scheme or icon). You can have both normal and incognito tabs open simultaneously. When you close all incognito tabs or exit the app, all incognito session data is automatically cleared.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Incognito Mode is useful when you want to browse without leaving traces on your device, such as when shopping for gifts, using a shared device, or accessing websites without affecting your browsing history and cookies.</p>

        <h2>10. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser integrates several third-party services to provide essential functionality and improve app quality. These services may collect and process certain data according to their own privacy policies. Here's a complete list of third-party services we use and what data they may access:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Websites You Visit:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> When you browse websites using Swift Go Browser, those websites may collect data according to their own privacy policies. This includes cookies, tracking scripts, analytics, and any information you provide to those websites. We have no control over third-party websites' data collection practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each website you visit.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> We do NOT sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for their marketing purposes. The only data sharing that occurs is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With AdMob/Firebase as described above (automated and necessary for app functionality).</li>
            <li>With websites you choose to visit (as part of normal browsing).</li>
            <li>As required by law or legal process.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> Some third-party services (Google AdMob, Firebase) may transfer data to servers located outside your country. These services comply with applicable data protection laws and use appropriate safeguards for international transfers.</p>

        <h2>11. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Swift Go Browser is a general-purpose web browser and is not specifically designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations protecting children's privacy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. The app does not have age verification mechanisms, as it's a browser that provides access to the open internet. We rely on parents and guardians to monitor their children's device usage and internet access.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Parental Responsibility:</strong> If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided personal information to us or through websites accessed via our browser, please contact us immediately. We will take steps to remove such information from our systems.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AdMob & Children:</strong> Our AdMob integration is configured to comply with COPPA and Google's policies regarding child-directed content. We do not enable personalized ads for child-directed content. However, since Swift Go is a general browser that can access any website, parents should use parental control software and supervise their children's internet usage.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Recommendations for Parents:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Android's parental control features and restricted user profiles.</li>
            <li>Install parental control apps that filter web content.</li>
            <li>Educate children about online safety and privacy.</li>
            <li>Monitor your child's browsing history and app usage.</li>
            <li>Consider using child-safe browsers specifically designed for children instead of general-purpose browsers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Third-Party Websites:</strong> Websites accessed through Swift Go Browser may have their own policies regarding children's privacy. We have no control over third-party websites and cannot guarantee they comply with COPPA. Parents should review the privacy policies of websites their children visit.</p>
        
        <p>If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at the email provided in Section 15.</p>

        <h2>12. Data Security & Protection</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Here's how we protect your data:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Local Storage Security:</strong> All data stored by Swift Go Browser (history, bookmarks, preferences, download records) is stored in the app's private directory, which is protected by Android's app sandbox. Other apps cannot access this data without root access to your device. The app uses secure storage mechanisms provided by Android, including SharedPreferences for settings and Hive database for structured data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> When you visit HTTPS websites, your connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. This encryption is handled by the website and the Android WebView component. We display security indicators to help you identify secure connections. However, we cannot guarantee the security of HTTP (non-encrypted) connections, which is why we warn you about insecure websites.</p>
        
        <p><strong>No Remote Storage:</strong> We do NOT store your browsing data, history, bookmarks, or any personal information on remote servers. Everything stays on your device. This significantly reduces the risk of data breaches, as there's no central database of user information that could be compromised.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Secure Permissions:</strong> We implement runtime permission requests, ensuring that sensitive device features (camera, microphone, location, storage) are only accessed when explicitly needed and authorized by you. Permissions are enforced by the Android operating system.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> For third-party services (AdMob, Firebase), we rely on Google's security infrastructure, which includes encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Google is a leader in data security and complies with international security standards.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Download Security:</strong> Downloaded files are scanned by your device's security software (if installed). We warn you about potentially dangerous file types (APK, EXE) before downloading. However, we recommend using antivirus software and being cautious about what files you download from the internet.</p>
        
        <p><strong>App Updates:</strong> We regularly update the app to patch security vulnerabilities, update dependencies, and improve security features. We recommend keeping Swift Go Browser updated to the latest version for optimal security.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> While we implement strong security measures, no system is completely secure. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device secure with a lock screen password/PIN.</li>
            <li>Not rooting your device, which can compromise Android's security model.</li>
            <li>Being cautious about which websites you visit and what information you provide to them.</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system and security patches up to date.</li>
            <li>Using secure Wi-Fi networks and avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Data Breach Notification:</strong> In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting user data, we will notify affected users in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. However, since we don't store user data on our servers, the risk of such a breach is minimal.</p>

        <h2>13. Your Privacy Rights & Choices</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data and privacy when using Swift Go Browser. Here are your rights and how to exercise them:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can access all data stored by the app at any time. Your browsing history is available in the History screen, bookmarks in the Bookmarks screen, downloads in the Downloads screen, and app settings in the Settings screen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete your data at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual Items:</strong> Delete specific history entries, bookmarks, or downloads by swiping or using delete buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk Deletion:</strong> Use the "Clear Browser Data" feature in Settings to delete all history, cookies, cache, and other browsing data at once.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Removal:</strong> Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all app data from your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Control Permissions:</strong> You can review and modify all app permissions at any time from Android Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Permissions. You can revoke any permission, though this may affect related functionality.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Going to your device Settings > Google > Ads.</li>
            <li>Enabling "Opt out of Ads Personalization."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will prevent AdMob from using your advertising ID for personalized ads, though you'll still see non-personalized ads.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Disable Notifications:</strong> You can disable all notifications from Settings > Apps > Swift Go Browser > Notifications, or customize notification channels to control which types of notifications you receive.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Use Incognito Mode:</strong> You can browse privately using Incognito Mode, which prevents local storage of history, cookies, and cache for that session.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can access it through the app's interface. However, we don't currently provide an export feature for bulk data export. If you need to export your data, please contact us.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to data processing by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disabling specific features that collect data.</li>
            <li>Using Incognito Mode for private browsing.</li>
            <li>Opting out of personalized ads.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app if you disagree with our practices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> If you believe we have violated your privacy rights or applicable data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>
        
        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights (CCPA):</strong> If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to delete personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. We do NOT sell personal information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>European Privacy Rights (GDPR):</strong> If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation, including the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection. Since we don't collect or store personal data on our servers, most GDPR requests can be fulfilled by using the app's built-in data management features.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How to Exercise Your Rights:</strong> Most rights can be exercised directly through the app's interface. For requests that require our assistance, please contact us at the email address provided in Section 15.</p>
