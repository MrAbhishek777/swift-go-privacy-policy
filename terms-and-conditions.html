        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Important Clarification - Third-Party Content:</strong> Swift Go Browser acts solely as a conduit or intermediary tool that displays web content hosted on third-party servers. The Developer does not create, host, control, modify, curate, or exercise editorial control over any websites or web content accessed through the App. All content displayed on websites you visit (including text, images, videos, advertisements, interactive elements, and any other materials) is the sole responsibility of the respective website owners, publishers, and content creators.</p>
        
        <p>Swift Go Browser does not endorse, recommend, verify, or guarantee the accuracy, legality, safety, appropriateness, or quality of any third-party website, service, product, or information accessed through the App. The presence of any website in your browsing history or bookmarks does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the Developer.</p>

        <p><strong>14.4 Your Choices:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings (Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization). Opting out will not reduce the number of ads you see but will make them less relevant to your interests.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.5 Advertiser Interactions:</strong> Any interactions you have with advertisers, including clicking on ads or purchasing products/services from advertisers, are solely between you and the advertiser.
